1. Tell me about yourself.简单的自我介绍

My name is Niu Jiaxing. I am a graduate students in third grade of Northwestern Polytechnical University.and  My major is software engineering.

The languages I am more familiar with are python and c++, and the database in the project is MySQL. I also have a better understanding of the basics of computer networks, databases, and operating systems.
I usually pay attention to open source code repositories (such as github) and some cloud platforms (for example google Cloud). I will also update some of the problems I encountered in my projects on my blog. 

I worked as an intern at Bosch from August last year to March this year. Our department is responsible for  camera function development. I participated in the development of vehicle and pedestrian detection parts, and I was also responsible for writing some scripts. During the period, two problems were mainly solved, the automated statistical system KPI (the accuracy rate of camera recognition) and the improvement of the truck recognition rate.

At the same time, when processing the data, it was found that the recognition of the van truck was not ideal. By connecting an auxiliary model for the truck in series outside the original model, the recognition rate of the van truck was finally reached 0.4-0.7.

I have also studied some engineering projects. Recently I am working on the pipeline construction of a real-time video analysis system. The modules used are Dataflow and Video Intelligence API. The system function is to analyze the surveillance video pictures taken by the camera and follow the set alarm conditions. Automatic alarm,
